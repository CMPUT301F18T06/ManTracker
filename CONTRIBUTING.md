## Branch Creation Standards

If a branch is intended to merge into master, it should follow a naming convention of `<intention name>/<intention description>`

## Pull Request Process

[https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Pull-Request-Checklist](Pull Request Checklist)

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed.

2.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface and any relavent file/code changes. 

3.  If from Prototype to Master, increase the version numbers in all files to the version this Pull Request represents.

4.  Avoid pull requests that address multiple features or issues.
